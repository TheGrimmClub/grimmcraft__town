"""filesystem — the single, learner-friendly interface to the file world.

Instead of importing ``os``, ``pathlib``, ``zipfile``, ``ftplib`` and
``urllib`` all over the place, the GrimmCraft Town tools import *this* package.
It keeps the "how do I touch files, archives and remote servers" knowledge
in one small, well-documented place.

Minecraft-specific reading (NBT, regions, world info) lives in the sibling
``minecraft`` package, which builds on this one.

Quick tour::

    from filesystem import paths, archive, transfer, config

    world = paths.locate_directory("./_input")   # find a folder with level.dat
    archive.create_archive(world, "out.zip")     # zip it (skips macOS junk)
"""
